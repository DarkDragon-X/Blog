# Blog

A WIP blog that uses Django CMS paired with static HTML templates to build a dynamic blog. The blog has a system to display uploaded photos and posts. Currently, the blog also makes use of static files: this needs to be updated for the sake of deployment.

### The media_root folder has temporary photos used for placeholders.
